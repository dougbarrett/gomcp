Create BUG-CLOSURE.md documenting the verification evidence:

For Bug #a9479784 (Controller methods):
- Original issue: HXRedirect, Component, CSRFToken undefined
- Fix location: internal/templates/wizard/controller.go.tmpl (Phase 2)
- Verified by: Generated code compiles (08-02)
- Evidence: grep results from 08-01 showing correct methods

For Bug #cb94adf6 (Service import):
- Original issue: Repository type undefined
- Fix location: internal/templates/wizard/draft_service.go.tmpl (Phase 3)
- Verified by: Generated code compiles (08-02)
- Evidence: grep results from 08-01 showing wizarddraftrepo import

Include specific commit references from prior phase summaries.

  <action>
Use MCP bug tracking tools to close both bugs:

1. Close bug #a9479784-4350-4d4b-acb1-a54a5898c353
   - Reason: All 8 CTRL issues fixed in Phase 2, verified compiles in Phase 8

2. Close bug #cb94adf6-ca95-4e92-978c-98e813e09b49
   - Reason: SVC-001 and SVC-002 fixed in Phase 3, verified compiles in Phase 8
  </action>
  <verify>
- mcp__mcp-mgr__list_bugs shows both bugs as closed
- Or mcp__mcp-mgr__get_bug for each shows status: closed
  </verify>
  <done>Both bugs closed in tracking system</done>
</task>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] BUG-CLOSURE.md documents both bugs with evidence
- [ ] Bug #a9479784 closed
- [ ] Bug #cb94adf6 closed
- [ ] mcp__mcp-mgr__list_bugs shows 0 open bugs (or only unrelated bugs)

<success_criteria>

- Both reported bugs officially closed
- Evidence documented for future reference
- Bug tracking system reflects resolved status
